    <h5>Make a Post & Rung Chair</h5>
    <p>
      In this <strong>four days </strong>class, students will learn various aspects of traditional chair making such as steam bending, timber selection, shaping parts on a shave horse with drawknife and spokeshave, round mortise and tenon joinery, grain orientation for joinery and glueing up with hot hide glue as well as weaving with rattan.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be an intensive class that places a heavy emphasis on hand tool work. Students can expect a certain level of labour required. The hard work results in a beautiful and comfortable dining chair that will last.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep learning as effective as possible, this class will be conducted with a maximum of three students.
