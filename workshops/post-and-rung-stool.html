    <h5>Make a Post & Rung Stool</h5>
    <p>
      In this two days class, each student will build a post & rung stool with a weaved seat. Students will learn various aspects of traditional chair making such as timber selection, shaping stool parts on a shave horse with drawknife and spokeshave, mortise and tenon joinery, grain orientation for joinery and glueing up with hot hide glue.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be an intensive class that places a heavy emphasis on hand tool work. Students can expect a certain level of labour required. The hard work results in a beautiful, sturdy and comfortable stool that can last.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep learning as effective as possible, there will only be a maximum of three students in a class.
    </p>

      All required tools and materials will be provided. Terms & Conditions apply, <a href="/workshops/terms-and-conditions/">please read</a>.
