    <h5>Make an Occasional Bench</h5>
    <p>
      This class has been designed for a <strong>team of two</strong> to learn a different way of chairmaking where it borrows techniques from Windsor chair making that utilises spokeshave and drawknife to shape and smoothen parts of the seat and undercarriage. Students will also get a chance to try out woodturning on a lathe under instructorâ€™s supervision.

      This will be an intensive class that places a heavy emphasis on hand tool work. Students can expect a certain level of labour required.
